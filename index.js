/*Create a function `johnLennonFacts`. This function will accept one argument, an
array of facts about John Lennon (note that it might not be exactly the
following facts):

```js
const facts = [
  "He was the last Beatle to learn to drive",
  "He was never a vegetarian",
  "He was a choir boy and boy scout",
  "He hated the sound of his own voice"
];
```

Use a while loop to loop over the facts array and add `"!!!"` to the end of
every fact. The function should return an array of strings with exclamation
points.*/
